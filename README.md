RimWorld-Templates
==================

A list of translate-ready files in the correct syntax.

__Updated for alpha 12!__

I generated them using a python script so there may be things missing or incorrect. I was more safe than sorry, so I made sure these templates don't generate any errors in game.

I've included the script here too: [RimWorld_DefsToDefinjecteds.py](RimWorld_DefsToDefinjecteds.py)

With [RimWorld_SimplifyPathTranslations.py](RimWorld_SimplifyPathTranslations.py) you can convert the complex multi line path translations to the new simpler single line format.

With [RimWorld_CompareTranslations.py](RimWorld_CompareTranslations.py) you can compare two different translations.

With [RimWorld_FindUntranslated.py](RimWorld_FindUntranslated.py) you can find tags with unmodified texts.
